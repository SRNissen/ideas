Inspirations:
* The concept of title insurance
* the Complex Systems podcast episode where Jim McKenzie was guest.

It used to be that ownership was handled by special brands, seals or stamps along the maker's mark

A creates something for A, then later sells to B, whose heir C receives it after B's death, and C currently holds it

The branding/stamping area looks like:

W - A Maker
A - B Sale
B - C Inheritance

(W is either "A" if "A" does this unwitnessed, or the stamp/seal/brand of  a witness)

And if you (D) want to buy it from C, you and C both brand it with yet another line, like so:

C - D Sale

===

But the whole place has been taken over by somebody else who uses paper records. Important deeds are stamped with a final line:

D - R Registered

which indicates that ownership is now registered on paper by the government instead. The "R" seal is incredibly potent for shenanigans, especially in real estate.

And one has been lost. Or you find it in a dungeon.
