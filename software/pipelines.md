Observations

- The best standardized devops tools are developed by people who:
  - Are dedicated and skilled devops people,
  - Optimize for scenarios that are common across projects,
  - Provide extreme scriptability, knowing that nothing is *really* common.
  - *Don't* work for *your* company.
- The best local devops tools are provided by people who:
  - Are dedicated and skilled devops people,
  - optimize directly for their local requirements
  - EITHER develop extremely bespoke local solutions
  - OR create scripts and templates that fit their local environment
- And yet: The most common devops experiences I have had have been terrible.

Something something synthesis: Script *above* script, non-ops dev should never write yml.
