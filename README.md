Various ideas that somebody (me?) should maybe execute on.

If they have the time and they care.

There's no license on this repo, i.e. all the *actual IP* in this repo is fully all-rights-reserved, but it's a public repo anyway because if you want to take any of these ideas and *execute* on them, that'd be great.
